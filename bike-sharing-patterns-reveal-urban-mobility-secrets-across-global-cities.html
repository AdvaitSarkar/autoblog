Based on research comparing bike usage patterns in ten cities, the study uncovers how different-sized systems share surprising similarities despite geographical and cultural differences. The full paper “Comparing Cities’ Cycling Patterns Using Online Shared Bicycle Maps” by Sarkar, Lathia, and Mascolo provides insights that could help design better bike sharing systems for cities everywhere.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Sarkar, A., Lathia, N., &amp; Mascolo, C. (2015). Comparing Cities’ Cycling Patterns Using Online Shared Bicycle Maps. Transportation, 42(4), 541-559. DOI: 10.1007/s11116-015-9599-9</p><h2 id="online-bike-maps-hold-treasure-troves-of-urban-mobility-data">Online Bike Maps Hold Treasure Troves of Urban Mobility Data</h2><p>The humble bike station map – a digital tool most cyclists check quickly before deciding where to pick up or drop off their shared bicycle – contains multitudes. These online maps, designed primarily to show available bikes and parking slots, can capture the pulse of city mobility when monitored over time.</p><p>Researchers have discovered that regularly collecting data from these maps allows for deep analysis of urban cycling trends without requiring access to proprietary system data. The study analyzed 4.5 months of data from 10 different bike sharing systems spanning 996 stations across 6 countries, creating a dataset of over 100 million samples.</p><p>“Bicycle sharing systems are increasingly being deployed in urban areas around the world, alongside online maps that disclose the state (i.e., location, number of bicycles/number of free parking slots) of stations in each city,” notes the study. This proliferation of systems provides a unique opportunity to compare mobility patterns across diverse urban environments.</p><h2 id="small-bike-systems-act-alike-while-large-systems-show-unique-patterns">Small Bike Systems Act Alike While Large Systems Show Unique Patterns</h2><p>Perhaps the most surprising finding from the research challenges conventional wisdom about bike sharing systems. While previous studies examining individual cities had suggested that each city has entirely unique usage patterns, this cross-city comparison revealed something different: small systems tend to behave similarly regardless of geography.</p><p>“While an aggregate comparison supports the view of cities having unique usage patterns, results of applying unsupervised learning to the temporal data shows that, instead, only the larger systems display heterogeneous behaviour, indicating that many of these systems share intrinsic similarities,” the paper states.</p><p>When researchers applied clustering techniques to analyze station behavior across all cities, they discovered that stations tend to fall into three main behavioral categories regardless of which city they’re in:</p><ol><li>“Morning sink, daytime source” stations that accumulate bikes in the morning and empty throughout the day</li><li>“Morning source, daytime sink” stations that empty in the morning and fill up during the day</li><li>“Flat” stations with relatively consistent occupancy throughout the day</li></ol><p>Interestingly, the smaller systems (like those in Girona, Spain and João Pessoa, Brazil) consisted almost entirely of “flat” stations with similar behavior patterns. Only in larger systems like London and Barcelona did significant heterogeneity appear.</p><h2 id="geography-shapes-cycling-patterns-in-predictable-ways">Geography Shapes Cycling Patterns in Predictable Ways</h2><p>The geographical distribution of these station types tells a compelling story about urban mobility. In London, the clustering revealed a concentric pattern with “morning sink” stations concentrated in the center, surrounded by layers of “flat” stations, with “morning source” stations on the periphery.</p><p>“This reflects a morning surge of bicycles from outside the centre moving inwards, and a slow outwards flow over the course of the day,” explains the paper. This pattern suggests commuter behavior, with people cycling into the city center for work in the morning and returning to residential areas in the evening.</p><p>Barcelona’s pattern reflects a different geographical reality. “Barcelona’s morning sink stations run through the city centre and spread out along the coast, and the morning source stations are spread out over the rest of the city,” the study found. “This map corresponds well with Barcelona’s elevation; it is in a hilly region and the placement of the ‘sink’ stations corresponds to lower elevations, while the ‘source’ stations are at higher elevations.”</p><p>This pattern illustrates a natural tendency that cyclists around the world can relate to: people prefer riding downhill rather than uphill.</p><h2 id="bike-availability-is-relatively-stable-in-most-cities">Bike Availability Is Relatively Stable in Most Cities</h2><p>Another aspect of the research involved predicting station occupancy. The researchers tested various prediction models to forecast how many bicycles would be available at stations at different time horizons (6, 12, 24, and 48 minutes in the future).</p><p>Surprisingly, a simple “static model” that assumes the current number of bikes will remain unchanged outperformed more sophisticated approaches like neural networks and decision tree ensembles in most cases. This suggests that for many stations, occupancy levels change relatively slowly and predictably.</p><p>However, prediction accuracy varied based on system size. “For the larger systems, prediction errors for the 2-minute series are almost identical to those of the 6-minute series. However, for the smaller systems, a variety of differences is observed,” the research notes.</p><p>The study also found that prediction models for larger systems remained accurate even when using older training data, while smaller systems required more recent data for accurate predictions. This suggests that usage patterns in larger systems are more stable over time, despite being more spatially diverse.</p><h2 id="bike-sharing-data-can-improve-urban-transportation-planning">Bike Sharing Data Can Improve Urban Transportation Planning</h2><p>These findings have important implications for managing existing bike sharing systems and planning new ones. Understanding which stations act as “sinks” or “sources” at different times can help optimize bicycle redistribution, a perennial challenge for bike sharing systems.</p><p>“Clustering methodologies such as ours could inform the planning of efficient redistribution schemes, by categorising areas of cities as ‘sinks’ or ‘sources’, or by identifying optimal times for triggering the dispatch of redistribution vehicles based on the aggregate occupancy behaviour,” the paper suggests.</p><p>For cities planning new bike sharing deployments, the research provides insights into how system size affects station behavior. Smaller systems tend toward homogeneity, while heterogeneity emerges with scale. This knowledge could help cities better anticipate how their systems will function as they grow.</p><p>The research demonstrates that there’s tremendous value hidden in online bike maps. By continuously monitoring them, patterns emerge that can help improve urban mobility and make bike sharing systems more efficient and user-friendly.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Sarkar, A., Lathia, N., &amp; Mascolo, C.
