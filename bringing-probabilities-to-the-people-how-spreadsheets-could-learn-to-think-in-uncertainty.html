It explains the study’s qualitative research into spreadsheet user behaviors and presents the proposed technical enhancements to make probabilistic modeling more intuitive and accessible.</p><p>Reference: Borghouts, J., Gordon, A.

Springer International Publishing. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30281-8_1">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30281-8_1</a></p><h2 id="probabilistic-thinking-is-hard-probabilistic-coding-is-harder">Probabilistic thinking is hard. Probabilistic coding is harder.</h2><p>It’s one thing to say, “We might not make budget this month.”<br>It’s another to code that uncertainty into a model that can tell you, mathematically, what “might” really means.</p><p>Probabilistic programming is a way to model uncertainty by writing code that says, in essence: “This part’s a guess. This part’s a guess too. Tell me what happens.” Traditionally, it lives in the realm of expert statisticians and data scientists, working with tools like Stan or BUGS.</p><p>But tens or hundreds of millions of people already do informal modeling under uncertainty. They use Excel. They make budgets, forecasts, and plans that mix hard data with educated guesses. They do this without thinking of themselves as programmers or probabilists. This paper asks: What if spreadsheets learned to speak uncertainty in a more formal, helpful way?</p><h2 id="spreadsheet-users-deal-with-uncertainty-constantly-but-informally">Spreadsheet users deal with uncertainty constantly, but informally.</h2><p>Interviews with 11 spreadsheet users revealed six recurring types of uncertainty in their everyday work: estimates, dynamic data, errors, missing data, unfindable data, and untraceable data.</p><p>By far the most common? Estimates. As one participant put it, “All we can do is make best estimates.”</p><p>Users cope through a wide range of strategies: from acquiring more data, to adding comments, to simply ignoring the problem. Some highlight cells. Others explain the fuzziness verbally in reports. A few run multiple scenarios manually, copying the sheet over and over to simulate “what if” cases.</p><p>The ingenuity is impressive. The lack of structured support is striking.</p><h2 id="formal-tools-for-uncertainty-in-spreadsheets-exist-but-are-barely-used">Formal tools for uncertainty in spreadsheets exist, but are barely used.</h2><p>Many spreadsheets today include basic probabilistic tools like the <code>RAND()</code> function or Monte Carlo simulations. Add-ins like @Risk or Crystal Ball allow more sophisticated modeling. Yet usage is niche.</p><p>One key reason: they require users to simulate not just the data, but the underlying statistical inference. That is, users must manually replicate the logic of uncertainty.</p><p>In contrast, probabilistic programming lets users define a model, such as “Income is fixed; expenses vary”, and lets the system figure out the math. This automation is powerful. But traditional probabilistic programming languages are intimidating. The average spreadsheet user isn’t likely to download Stan to model their electric bill.</p><p>The paper proposes a middle ground: bringing probabilistic programming principles <em>into</em> the spreadsheet environment itself.</p><h2 id="proposed-upgrades-let-cells-hold-uncertainty-and-propagate-it-through-formulas">Proposed upgrades: Let cells hold uncertainty and propagate it through formulas.</h2><p>The authors explore three kinds of “uncertain values” a cell might hold:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Qualitative uncertainty</strong>: A value tagged as approximate. For example, <code>ESTIMATE(100)</code> indicates a rough guess. This label can propagate through calculations, so the final balance might show as <code>ESTIMATE(15)</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Possibilistic uncertainty</strong>: A set of discrete scenarios. For instance, <code>SCENARIOS(50, 100, 150)</code> might represent best, expected, and worst-case costs for utilities. The formulas downstream return sets too, like <code>SCENARIOS(65, 15, -35)</code> for a budget balance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Probabilistic uncertainty</strong>: A full probability distribution, like <code>DIST.TRIANG(50, 150, 100)</code>, indicating a most likely value with a known spread. This allows calculations like, “What’s the chance I go into overdraft?” with a result like “25%.”</p></li></ul><p>Each level increases in sophistication and demands more from the user.</p><h2 id="more-robust-modeling-could-be-enabled-by-sheet-defined-functions">More robust modeling could be enabled by “sheet-defined functions.”</h2><p>One elegant solution for complexity is to encapsulate reusable logic inside what the authors call “sheet-defined functions.” These are like mini-programs defined within a sheet, which take parameters and return outputs. Clara, a fictional user modeling her sofa budget, could define her budget as a function that takes one input - her utilities bill, and returns whether she goes over.</p><p>With this function, she could feed in many different inputs, either scenarios or random samples, and collect outputs without rewriting formulas for each case. It’s clean, scalable, and more reliable than the copy-and-paste chaos of typical Monte Carlo simulations.</p><h2 id="probabilistic-programming-wont-fix-every-type-of-uncertainty">Probabilistic programming won’t fix every type of uncertainty.</h2><p>Despite the technical elegance of uncertain values and sheet-defined functions, the authors emphasize that these tools can’t solve everything.</p><p>Two categories of uncertainty, <em>unfindable data</em> and <em>untraceable data</em>, stem not from randomness, but from limitations in how data is structured or tracked. As one user noted, they couldn’t extract weekend hours from a timesheet, not because the data was missing, but because they didn’t know how to write the formula.</p><p>Probabilistic models can’t help much when users can’t access or understand their own data. For that, better tools for formula authoring, layout guidance, and data provenance would be needed.</p><h2 id="users-want-support-for-uncertainty-but-not-everyone-wants-probability">Users want support for uncertainty, but not everyone wants probability.</h2><p>Interestingly, while probabilistic tools are powerful, they are not always the right fit. Possibilistic models like scenario analysis are already widely used and well understood. Qualitative tags are simple but broadly useful. Probabilistic models are precise, but often intimidating for non-experts.</p><p>The authors conclude: “No single formalism emerges the clear winner.” In fact, probabilistic representations may not be worth implementing on their own unless paired with clearer input interfaces, visualization tools, and guidance for interpreting outputs.</p><h2 id="a-cautious-optimism-for-the-probabilistic-spreadsheet-future">A cautious optimism for the probabilistic spreadsheet future.</h2><p>Spreadsheets have always been a platform for democratizing computation. From the first <code>SUM()</code> to today’s pivot tables, they offer power without programming.</p><p>End-user probabilistic programming could be the next evolution but only if it’s introduced carefully. Simplicity matters. Interpretability matters. Visual feedback matters.</p><p>Above all, flexibility matters. As one participant explained, “We dont know exactly what’s going to happen. All we can do is make best estimates.”</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Borghouts, J., Gordon, A. D., Sarkar, A., &amp; Toronto, N. (2019). End-user probabilistic programming.
