The study reveals that most Excel learning happens informally through social interactions rather than formal training. The paper analyzed interviews with seven participants of varying expertise levels to understand the spreadsheet learning process.</p><p>Reference: Sarkar, A., &amp; Gordon, A. D. (2018, September). How do people learn to use spreadsheets? (Work in progress). In Proceedings of the 29th Annual Conference of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG 2018) (pp. 28–35).</p><h2 id="spreadsheet-learning-rarely-happens-in-classrooms">Spreadsheet Learning Rarely Happens in Classrooms</h2><p>Forget formal training courses and thick Excel manuals. The reality of how most people learn spreadsheet skills is far more organic and messy. According to research, Excel users typically don’t learn through structured training but instead through a combination of necessity, observation, and social connections.</p><p>“I never did a course in Excel. I’ve never taken a formal learning in Excel,” admitted one study participant who works as a small company accountant. This sentiment was echoed across participants of various expertise levels, from occasional users to sophisticated developers who create custom spreadsheet add-ins.</p><p>The formal documentation that comes with spreadsheet software often goes unused. Users reported finding built-in help features inadequate for discovering new functions. As one examination marking overseer put it: “I don’t find help in [the tool] particularly useful as a way of discovering a function. It’s very useful when you’ve worked out what function, to understand how it works. But I don’t find it particularly useful for finding the right function to use.”</p><h2 id="learning-spreadsheets-is-driven-by-immediate-problems-not-abstract-interest">Learning Spreadsheets Is Driven by Immediate Problems, Not Abstract Interest</h2><p>Most spreadsheet learning is opportunistic. Users typically acquire new skills when they encounter a specific problem that demands a solution beyond their current knowledge base.</p><p>“I know what I know how to use because it’s what I’ve needed,” explained one study participant. “Effectively, I’ve learnt the functions as I’ve come across a need to use them, rather than just learning things abstractly.”</p><p>This problem-driven approach creates an interesting learning pattern. Rather than systematically working through tutorials, users develop their skillset in an uneven, almost haphazard way based on what challenges they’ve faced. Someone might be proficient with complex financial functions but completely unaware of basic data visualization techniques simply because they’ve never needed to create charts.</p><p>A professional accountant in the study described a situation where necessity forced learning: “There was this part of the APT (arbitrage pricing theory) that required a normal distribution and there was no function in Excel to do that. And given an obstacle, I then had to get around it, because it was a University deliverable. Given that obstacle, many hours were spent beating my head against the glass pane of that Mac trying to work out how to do it, and as a consequence, I learnt Excel.”</p><h2 id="the-excel-guru-effect-how-spreadsheet-knowledge-spreads-through-social-networks">The Excel Guru Effect: How Spreadsheet Knowledge Spreads Through Social Networks</h2><p>Perhaps the most notable finding is how critical social connections are for spreadsheet learning. Within organizations, knowledge about Excel features and techniques typically spreads from person to person rather than from documentation to person.</p><p>“I used to have a colleague years ago. He was a real whiz with spreadsheets,” recalled one large company accountant. “Occasionally he would point out ‘oh, you can simplify this by putting this in there’ and I guess subliminally you take these things in.”</p><p>This social learning creates informal networks of expertise within organizations, with certain individuals becoming known as spreadsheet “gurus” who others seek out for help. The learning process resembles an apprenticeship model where novices learn by watching and getting guidance from more experienced users.</p><p>An energy demand modeller explained: “Consultancies work on an apprenticeship model, so there’s usually someone more senior on the project, who will advise… you can access advice from people in your team and other gurus around the company.”</p><p>This social spread of knowledge helps explain why certain Excel techniques become common in particular workplaces while remaining unknown in others. When an influential person within an organization adopts a particular approach, it tends to spread through the office.</p><h2 id="the-feature-adoption-trinity-discovery-expertise-and-attention-investment">The Feature Adoption Trinity: Discovery, Expertise, and Attention Investment</h2><p>The research suggests that adopting new Excel features involves three distinct components: discovery, expertise acquisition, and attention investment (a concept describing how users decide whether learning something new is worth the effort).</p><p>Feature discovery often happens when users see the feature being used in someone else’s spreadsheet. As one climate change modeller explained: “So for example at some point there was introduced SUMIFS. I must have just seen that in a spreadsheet somewhere and thought ‘what the hell is that?’ and at some point come back to it and looked at it in help, and decided that was the right thing to do.”</p><p>The visibility of features in shared spreadsheets creates natural learning moments. When users see something unfamiliar in a colleague’s work, it sparks curiosity that can lead to learning. This helps explain why visible features tend to spread more effectively than hidden ones.</p><h2 id="motivation-makes-the-difference-in-excel-mastery">Motivation Makes the Difference in Excel Mastery</h2><p>Not all spreadsheet users approach learning the same way. The research identifies a spectrum of intrinsic motivation that significantly impacts how people engage with the software.</p><p>Users with low intrinsic motivation tend to learn passively, picking up techniques only when absolutely necessary or when directly shown by colleagues. They often develop “coping mechanisms” that let them accomplish tasks without learning more efficient methods. For example, they might manually type calculated values rather than learning formulas, or use arithmetic operators instead of functions like SUM.</p><p>In contrast, highly motivated users actively seek out knowledge, often through online forums and experimentation. “I went to those kind of fora, and then largely trial and error,” said one climate change modeller. “So trying it out and putting myself in the developer’s mindset here ‘surely this is how they would have done it’ and you try out something assuming that this is how they’ve done it and see if it works as it’s meant to work.”</p><p>These high-motivation users often approach spreadsheet tasks with an eye toward solving not just the immediate problem but a more general version that will be useful in the future. “And my approach to Excel was always to… on any given task, try and solve the task that was one step more general,” explained one participant.</p><h2 id="limitations-and-calls-for-further-research">Limitations and Calls for Further Research</h2><p>While insightful, this research was preliminary, based on interviews with only seven participants. This small sample size limits how confidently these findings can be generalized to the broader population of spreadsheet users. Additionally, the convenience sampling method may have introduced selection bias.</p><p>The gender distribution was also heavily skewed, with only one female participant. Previous research has suggested that gender differences may exist in technology adoption patterns, making this an important area for future research with more representative samples.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the findings align with earlier research on informal learning practices and offer valuable insights for designing spreadsheet features that better match how people actually learn.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Sarkar, A., &amp; Gordon, A.
