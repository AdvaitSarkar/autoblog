Breaking down the research paper “Visual Analytics as End-User Programming” by Sarkar et al. (2015), the article explores how two innovative tools—Teach and Try and Gatherminer—bridge the gap between programming languages and visual outputs, making sophisticated data analysis accessible to non-experts. The researchers demonstrate how visualization itself can become the programming language for analytical procedures.</p><p><strong>Reference:</strong> Sarkar, A., Blackwell, A. F., Jamnik, M., &amp; Spott, M. (2015, January). Visual analytics as end-user programming.

The tools of the trade—Excel, R, Python, SQL, Tableau—all involve some form of programming, whether that’s writing formulas, queries, or full-blown code. But there’s an inherent problem with these systems: they create a cognitive burden that excludes many potential users.</p><p>As the researchers note, “there is a disconnect between the programming language and the observable output; the metaphors used for each are discordant.” Imagine trying to analyze customer behavior data. Your data sits in a text file, your analysis happens in Python code, and your results appear as text on a command line. You need to mentally bridge these three different representations to make sense of everything.</p><p>This separation creates what the paper calls a “high expertise barrier to entry.” It’s like trying to cook a complex recipe where the ingredients are in one room, the utensils in another, and the instructions in a third. You’d spend more time running between rooms than actually cooking.</p><p>The paper introduces an alternative: What if the visualization itself could be the programming language?</p><h2 id="spreadsheets-can-become-intelligent-learning-interfaces">Spreadsheets Can Become Intelligent Learning Interfaces</h2><p>The first tool described is “Teach and Try,” which cleverly transforms ordinary spreadsheets into interfaces for building sophisticated statistical models.</p><p>Here’s how it works: You select cells containing data you’re confident about and click “Teach.” These cells become your training data, marked with a green checkmark. Then you select cells where you want predictions and click “Try.” If those cells are empty, they’ll be filled with predictions. If they contain values, they’re color-coded based on how closely they match what the model would predict.</p><p>“Using the familiar metaphor of the spreadsheet, Teach and Try unifies the visual representation of the programming language, the visual representation of the data, and the visual representation of the model output,” the paper explains.</p><p>Consider a teacher grading math exams. After grading several papers, they could “teach” the system the grading pattern (scores of 75+ get an A, 50-74 get a B, 49 and below get a C), then use “Try” to automatically grade the remaining papers. Or they could use it to check another teacher’s grading for consistency.</p><p>The insight here is that the spreadsheet itself becomes both the interface for programming and the display of results. No need to write separate code or interpret command-line outputs. The learning happens right where the data lives.</p><h2 id="strategic-visualizations-can-reveal-hidden-patterns-without-programming-expertise">Strategic Visualizations Can Reveal Hidden Patterns Without Programming Expertise</h2><p>The paper’s second tool, “Gatherminer,” tackles time series data using a visualization technique called a “gatherplot.”</p><p>Traditional time series visualizations often require extensive preprocessing before insights emerge. Gatherplots solve this by applying a strategic layout algorithm that automatically arranges similar time series closer together.</p><p>“The gatherplot is an augmented time series visualisation. It takes the form of a colour-mapped matrix where each row is an individual time series and each column is an individual time point,” the paper describes. This arrangement makes patterns leap out that would otherwise remain hidden.</p><p>But Gatherminer goes beyond visualization. It allows users to select interesting regions in the visualization itself, prompting the system to build a decision tree that explains what distinguishes those regions from others.</p><p>A business analyst examining customer purchase patterns could simply highlight a cluster of unusual activity, and Gatherminer would identify the factors that make those customers different. No SQL queries, no Python code, just direct interaction with the visualization.</p><p>“By bringing the interaction language closer to the visual representations of its output, that is, by attempting to unify ‘how we tell the computer to do it’ with ‘what we want the computer to do’, we hope to reduce the expertise requirements of these analytical procedures,” the researchers write.</p><h2 id="visual-programming-democratizes-access-to-advanced-analytics">Visual Programming Democratizes Access to Advanced Analytics</h2><p>The implications of this approach extend beyond making analysts’ lives easier. These techniques could fundamentally change who can perform sophisticated data analysis.</p><p>“Advanced data analytics is the preserve of a small group of highly-skilled professionals, despite the fact that a much larger population could benefit from access to sophisticated analytics,” the paper points out. By reducing the expertise barrier, these visual programming approaches could democratize access to powerful analytical tools.</p><p>A marketing manager who knows their data but lacks coding skills could use Teach and Try to build a predictive model of customer behavior. A production supervisor could use Gatherminer to identify patterns in manufacturing defects without needing a data scientist’s help.</p><p>This democratization has become increasingly important as data volumes grow and analytics becomes more valuable across all sectors of business and society. When the visualization is the programming language, the focus shifts from coding syntax to domain knowledge and analytical thinking.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-analytics-lies-in-bridging-visual-and-computational-thinking">The Future of Analytics Lies in Bridging Visual and Computational Thinking</h2><p>The ultimate goal described in this research is to unify “how we tell the computer to do it” with “what we want the computer to do.” This unification represents a shift in how we think about programming and data analysis.</p><p>Traditional programming separates the process from the result. Visual analytics as end-user programming merges them, creating a more intuitive and accessible approach.</p><p>As data continues to grow in importance, approaches that lower technical barriers while maintaining analytical power will be essential. By turning visualizations into programming interfaces, we can put powerful analytical tools into the hands of domain experts who understand the problems but lack traditional programming expertise.</p><p>The techniques described in this paper offer a glimpse of that future, where the distinction between visualizing data and analyzing it begins to blur, and where sophisticated analysis becomes accessible to anyone who can recognize a pattern in a visualization.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Sarkar, A., Blackwell, A.
