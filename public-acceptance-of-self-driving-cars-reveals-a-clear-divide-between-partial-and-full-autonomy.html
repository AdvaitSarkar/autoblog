The study reveals that people perceive only two meaningful levels of autonomy: partial and full, with significantly lower acceptance of fully autonomous vehicles. The findings suggest that automotive manufacturers and technology companies may need different approaches when developing and marketing self-driving cars.</p><p>Reference: Hewitt, C., Politis, I., Amanatidis, T., &amp; Sarkar, A.

How would you feel? According to recent research, probably not great.</p><p>As self-driving cars move from science fiction to reality, understanding public perception becomes crucial for their successful adoption. A study published in 2019 introduced a standardized framework called the Autonomous Vehicle Acceptance Model (AVAM) to measure how people view autonomous vehicles across different levels of automation.</p><p>“Most existing studies of public perception of AVs do not use established models of User Acceptance (UA). They are therefore difficult to make comparisons between or interpret in terms of UA,” the paper notes, highlighting a key gap the research aimed to fill.</p><p>The study examined responses from 187 participants across all six levels of vehicle autonomy defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous with no human intervention required).</p><h2 id="user-acceptance-decreases-as-autonomy-increases">User Acceptance Decreases as Autonomy Increases</h2><p>The research findings contradict what might seem intuitive: people actually reported lower expected performance and more difficulty using vehicles as autonomy increased. One might expect that more autonomous vehicles would be perceived as easier to use and more efficient, but the opposite proved true.</p><p>“Not only were participants more anxious about higher levels of autonomy, but they also reported lower expected performance and lower perceived ease-of-use,” the study reports. “This is directly opposed to what we might expect based on the motivating factors in the development of AV.”</p><p>Across nearly all measured factors, including perceived safety, attitude toward the technology, and intention to use the vehicles, participants showed a clear preference for lower levels of autonomy. Anxiety increased significantly with higher autonomy levels, while perceived safety decreased.</p><p>This reluctance isn’t entirely surprising given the novelty of the technology. New innovations often face initial skepticism, especially when they involve removing human control from potentially dangerous situations. The researchers suggest that “more work is needed by experts to clarify the capabilities and limitations of AVs in order to increase trust in the technology.”</p><h2 id="people-see-only-two-real-categories-partial-and-full-automation">People See Only Two Real Categories: Partial and Full Automation</h2><p>Perhaps the most intriguing finding was how people conceptualized different levels of autonomy. Despite the industry’s detailed six-level classification system, participants essentially perceived only two categories: partially autonomous (Levels 0-4) and fully autonomous (Level 5).</p><p>This was particularly evident when participants were asked about expected physical engagement with the vehicle. For Levels 0 through 4, participants rated the importance of using hands, feet, and eyes as consistently high, with only minor variations. But for Level 5, there was a dramatic drop in the perceived need for all three forms of engagement.</p><p>“The most likely explanation for this is that users perceive only two levels of autonomy: partial and full, without being able to differentiate well between different levels of partial autonomy,” the paper explains.</p><p>This finding has significant implications for how autonomous vehicles should be designed and marketed. It suggests that incremental improvements in autonomy between Levels 1-4 may not meaningfully change how users interact with or perceive these vehicles.</p><h2 id="the-industry-divide-reflects-public-perception">The Industry Divide Reflects Public Perception</h2><p>The study provides an interesting perspective on the current divide in autonomous vehicle development strategies. Some companies, like Tesla and Audi, are introducing autonomous features incrementally, addressing all levels of autonomy. Others, like Waymo and Uber, are aiming directly for Level 5 full autonomy.</p><p>“Technology companies such as Waymo and Uber aiming to directly develop and introduce L5 autonomous vehicles in service of any individual, irrespective of whether they hold a driving licence. In contrast, automotive manufacturers such as Tesla or Audi are aiming to introduce autonomous features incrementally,” the paper notes.</p><p>This industrial split may actually reflect the public’s binary perception of autonomy. If people don’t meaningfully distinguish between different levels of partial autonomy, the incremental approach might not yield the expected benefits in terms of user acceptance and market adoption.</p><h2 id="limitations-of-the-research-should-be-considered">Limitations of the Research Should Be Considered</h2><p>Several limitations should be noted when interpreting these results. The study participants were all from the United States and were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, which may have resulted in a more technology-oriented sample than the general population. Additionally, the researchers acknowledge that question order may have introduced some bias, though they defend this choice as helping participants “more easily envision vehicles when the technologies featured became incrementally more hypothetical.”</p><p>The study also primarily sampled current drivers, which might not reflect the views of non-drivers who might benefit most from fully autonomous vehicles. As the researchers note, “It might be interesting to assess the opinions of current non-drivers instead of existing drivers, who constitute the majority of the sample considered.”</p><h2 id="future-research-will-need-to-track-changing-perceptions">Future Research Will Need to Track Changing Perceptions</h2><p>Understanding and monitoring public perception will remain crucial as autonomous vehicle technology evolves. The researchers suggest that the AVAM provides a standardized framework that can be used to track changes in perception over time and across different cultures.</p><p>“The AVAM opens up scope for evaluation of many more causal factors of UA [User Acceptance] than are considered here,” the paper states, suggesting future studies could break down results by age, gender, driving experience, and cultural background.</p><p>As autonomous vehicles become more common on roads worldwide, these perceptions will likely shift. The key question remains whether the technology will evolve to meet user expectations, or whether user perceptions will adapt to embrace the new technology.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Hewitt, C., Politis, I., Amanatidis, T., &amp; Sarkar, A.
