The research reveals how analysts often struggle to translate high-level business questions into data analysis tasks, and proposes a prototype tool that allows collaborative sketching of time series data to clarify hypotheses.</p><p>Reference: Marasoiu, M., Blackwell, A. F., Sarkar, A., &amp; Spott, M. (2016). Clarifying hypotheses by sketching data. In Eurographics/IEEE VGTC Conference on Visualization (EuroVis 2016). The Eurographics Association. <a href="https://doi.org/10.2312/eurovisshort.20161173">https://doi.org/10.2312/eurovisshort.20161173</a></p><h2 id="data-analysts-spend-significant-time-teaching-statistics-to-their-clients">Data analysts spend significant time teaching statistics to their clients</h2><p>When was the last time you tried to explain a complex technical concept to someone with no background in your field? If you’re a data analyst, this might be a daily occurrence.</p><p>Data analysts frequently find themselves in the awkward position of being statistics teachers rather than pure analysts. Their clients come to them with vague requests and imprecise questions, often lacking the statistical vocabulary to articulate what they actually need.</p><p>“Discussions between data analysts and colleagues or clients with no statistical background are difficult, as the analyst often has to teach and explain their statistical and domain knowledge,” notes the research paper. This creates a peculiar dynamic where analysts must first educate before they can analyze.</p><p>The paper’s investigation into the work practices of data analysts who collaborate with non-experts uncovered several key challenges. Analysts reported that “they often need a conversation with the requester after receiving an email from them in order to clarify and fill in missing details of their high-level question.” These clarification calls are crucial but inefficient, especially when the data isn’t readily available during the conversation.</p><p>As one analyst in the study explained: “So when I get something like that it will usually be let’s have a look at it, let’s think about where the gaps are, got to list all the gaps, all of the things that I need answered now, then ask that question, get the information that I actually need to finish it off.”</p><p>Another analyst simply said: “Most often it’s a quick call saying ‘is this exactly what you’re after, do you need this, this and this and this?’”</p><h2 id="function-composition-offers-a-structured-way-to-sketch-time-series-data">Function composition offers a structured way to sketch time series data</h2><p>What if there was a better way to have these conversations? The researchers developed a prototype tool called “SelfRaisingData” that allows analysts to sketch time series data during these clarification calls, even when the actual data isn’t yet available.</p><p>Rather than free-hand drawing, which might be imprecise or difficult to adjust, the tool uses function composition. This mathematical approach allows users to build complex data patterns by combining simpler functions - like linear trends, periodic cycles, or exponential growth.</p><p>“We chose time series visualisation as our interviews suggest it to be one of the most used types of data that analysts work with,” explains the paper.</p><p>The prototype tool features a time series chart as its central component, with data points generated around shapes described through function composition. Functions can be dragged onto the chart from a tool panel, and each function can be modified independently through interactive controls.</p><p>This approach has distinct advantages over traditional sketching. When a user adjusts parameters of one function - such as changing the slope of a linear trend - it doesn’t affect other components of the visualization. This preserves the semantic meaning behind each component, making it easier to discuss specific hypotheses about the data.</p><p>“In contrast to sketching a line on paper, function composition adds hypothesis semantics to the visualisation,” the researchers write.</p><h2 id="users-found-the-function-composition-approach-intuitive-and-valuable">Users found the function composition approach intuitive and valuable</h2><p>To evaluate their tool, the researchers conducted two usability studies with participants who had technical backgrounds similar to data analysts. The results were encouraging.</p><p>Participants described the tool as “easy to use” and “fairly intuitive.” They appreciated the function composition principles, with one participant noting, “I liked being able to separate out the functions.”</p><p>Most importantly, an experienced visual analytics professional confirmed the tool’s potential usefulness in real-world scenarios:</p><p>“One of the biggest challenges I have in communicating to a client is to create dummy data to try and describe what I’m expecting to see, so actually being able to manipulate the dataset like that is a really useful concept.”</p><p>This validation from someone with extensive experience suggests the approach could address real communication gaps in the industry.</p><h2 id="the-balance-between-precision-and-sketchiness-remains-challenging">The balance between precision and sketchiness remains challenging</h2><p>Despite positive feedback, the tool revealed an interesting tension between precision and sketchiness. While some participants embraced the sketchy nature of the visualization, others wanted more control.</p><p>“I think the data points, being kinda farther away from the line served as a bit more of a distraction. I feel like it would be handy to be able to manipulate the lines more precisely,” noted one participant.</p><p>The researchers intentionally rendered the visualizations as ‘noisy’ scatterplots rather than precise line graphs to “reinforce that the sketch is a provisional, transient conversational aid.” This design choice pushes against users’ natural tendency to fixate on creating exact visualizations.</p><p>Some participants suggested that being able to adjust the variance of the data point distribution would be useful, either to show the degree of accuracy of the function composition or to make the visualization more realistic for different datasets.</p><h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2><p>Several limitations should be noted when interpreting this research. The study focused primarily on usability rather than evaluating how the tool would function in real collaborative settings. The researchers acknowledge that “further development would benefit from more discussions and studies of data analysts” and that they are “looking at testing the system in a business environment and studying how it would be used in collaborative analytics practice.”</p><p>Additionally, the current system only supports time series data visualized as scatter charts, a decision driven by their analyst interviews. While time series data might be common, it represents just one type of data analysis that professionals conduct.</p><p>The small sample size of the usability studies (6 participants each) and the fact that most participants were graduate students rather than professional analysts also suggests caution when generalizing the results.</p><p>Nevertheless, the research points to promising directions for improving collaboration between data analysts and their clients in the critical early stages of the analytical process when hypotheses are being clarified and refined.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Marasoiu, M., Blackwell, A.
