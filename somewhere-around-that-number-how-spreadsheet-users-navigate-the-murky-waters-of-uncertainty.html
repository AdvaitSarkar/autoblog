The study reveals that spreadsheets serve multiple roles beyond calculation, functioning as databases, templates, notepads, and exploration tools, with each role influencing how users manage uncertainty.</p><p>Reference: Borghouts, J., Gordon, A.

Somewhere around that number: An interview study of how spreadsheet users manage uncertainty. arXiv. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13072">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13072</a></p><h2 id="spreadsheets-are-the-swiss-army-knife-of-uncertainty-management">Spreadsheets are the Swiss Army knife of uncertainty management</h2><p>In the messy landscape of modern work, uncertainty lurks everywhere. The sales projection that might be off by 20%. The project timeline with tasks of unknown duration. The dataset with gaps and errors. When facing these challenges, professionals across industries reach for the same tool: the spreadsheet.</p><p>“Data uncertainty is ubiquitous in various settings,” notes the research paper at the heart of this discussion. “Academics may deal with noise and missing data in their datasets, managers make business decisions based on projected sales data, and project leaders adapt schedules based on estimated workload.”</p><p>But how exactly do people use spreadsheets to wrangle this uncertainty in their daily work? This question drove a team of researchers to interview 11 spreadsheet users from fields ranging from finance to academic research.</p><p>What they discovered was that the humble spreadsheet serves as far more than just a calculation tool. It functions as a database, template, notepad, and exploration tool, with each role influencing how users approach uncertainty. This multi-faceted functionality helps explain why, despite sophisticated alternatives, spreadsheets remain deeply embedded in organizational workflows when dealing with uncertain information.</p><h2 id="uncertainty-comes-in-many-flavors-that-spreadsheet-users-must-taste">Uncertainty comes in many flavors that spreadsheet users must taste</h2><p>The study identified several types of uncertainty that spreadsheet users regularly encounter. The most common? Estimates, those approximated values where the precise figure remains unknown. As one participant put it: “We’re talking about the future. We don’t know exactly what’s going to happen. All we can do is make best estimates.”</p><p>Other uncertainty types included missing data (values not recorded in datasets), errors (incorrect values or error messages), dynamic data (information that changes over time), untraceable data (information with unknown sources), and unfindable data (information that users couldn’t locate within their spreadsheets).</p><p>These uncertainty types don’t exist in isolation. They often coexist within the same spreadsheet, creating a complex ecosystem of certainty and doubt that users must navigate.</p><h2 id="the-spreadsheet-grid-becomes-a-visual-canvas-for-mapping-uncertainty">The spreadsheet grid becomes a visual canvas for mapping uncertainty</h2><p>One of the most interesting findings concerns how users visually represent uncertainty within the grid-based framework of spreadsheets. Since spreadsheets treat uncertain and certain values identically as deterministic numbers, users developed creative workarounds.</p><p>Some participants used color coding to indicate uncertainty levels: “Instead of having to scroll through each cell and looking at the actual value, you can tell it to conditionally format to green is low, red is high, and it’ll pick up quite easily where things might look a bit funny,” explained one participant.</p><p>Others distributed possible values across multiple cells for visual comparison or used formulas rather than static values to indicate uncertainty. One accountant used a system of green, yellow, and red to communicate reliability to clients, noting: “There’s a visceral immediacy to it, it’s traffic lights.”</p><p>The spatial properties of spreadsheets played a crucial role in uncertainty management. The grid layout allowed users to juxtapose different scenarios side by side for visual comparison, while formulas enabled them to define and explore relationships between variables.</p><h2 id="from-analysis-to-decision-making-uncertainty-gets-compressed-along-the-way">From analysis to decision-making, uncertainty gets compressed along the way</h2><p>An important pattern emerged regarding how uncertainty transforms as data moves through organizational workflows. Participants described a journey from raw, uncertain data to simplified presentations for decision-makers.</p><p>“The more senior you are, the more you want an answer, either yes or no, there’s not really a thing in-between,” noted a bank accountant.</p><p>The research identified three stages in this journey. First, uncertain data was collected and prepared for analysis. Next, users aimed to understand the level of uncertainty through scenario comparison and discussions with colleagues. Finally, uncertain data was transformed into simplified versions for decision-makers.</p><p>This compression of uncertainty from analysis to presentation wasn’t about hiding complexity but transforming it into a form that enabled action: “You will do all of the background analysis, and you walk in there with a simple decision for them. Come in there with eight, and they’ll look at you and go, ‘Well I’m not doing that, that’s your job to filter that.’”</p><h2 id="trust-trumps-accuracy-when-communicating-uncertainty">Trust trumps accuracy when communicating uncertainty</h2><p>When presenting uncertainty to others, participants prioritized building trust over conveying complete accuracy. Depending on the domain and audience, showing uncertainty could either increase or decrease trust.</p><p>“The only way to be honest about it is to put the uncertainty in there,” said one participant who presented climate change predictions to policy makers. Yet another participant who presented financial forecasts noted that uncertainty “shows ambiguity, and people just don’t like that.”</p><p>Spreadsheets played a vital role in building this trust by helping users construct narratives around uncertain data. The process of creating and manipulating spreadsheets improved users’ understanding of their data, which in turn boosted their confidence when presenting results to others.</p><h2 id="spreadsheet-limitations-create-opportunities-for-better-uncertainty-tools">Spreadsheet limitations create opportunities for better uncertainty tools</h2><p>The study revealed several limitations in how current spreadsheets support uncertainty management. For instance, spreadsheets force users to input one value per cell, treating uncertain values as discrete rather than connected. Users also struggled to compress comprehensive spreadsheets into formats suitable for decision-makers.</p><p>These limitations point toward opportunities for improved spreadsheet functionality. The researchers suggest potential directions like creating separate analysis and presentation layers, automatically highlighting uncertain data values, and enabling direct input of uncertain values as distributions rather than single points.</p><p>It should be noted that the study has limitations. All participants were male and used spreadsheets for work purposes, which may have influenced their strategies. The sample size of 11 participants also limits the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>Nevertheless, the research provides valuable insights into how the material features of spreadsheets both enable and constrain uncertainty work. By understanding these dynamics, we can reimagine how spreadsheet tools might offer richer support for handling uncertainty in our increasingly unpredictable world.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Borghouts, J., Gordon, A.
