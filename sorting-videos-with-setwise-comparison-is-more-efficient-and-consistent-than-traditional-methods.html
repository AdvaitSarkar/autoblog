The technique was developed to support computer vision systems in healthcare but could apply to many domains requiring expert judgment. The researchers found that their new approach not only reduced labeling time dramatically but also unexpectedly improved consistency between different raters.</p><p>Reference: Sarkar, A., Morrison, C., Dorn, J.

Your job is to rate each patient’s tremor severity on a scale from 0 to 4. Sounds straightforward, right?</p><p>Not quite. When multiple neurologists rate the same videos, they often disagree significantly. In one study, agreement on previously established “gold standard” videos ranged from just 23% to 69%.</p><p>This inconsistency poses a significant problem for computer vision systems that need reliable labels to learn from. The paper “Setwise Comparison: Consistent, Scalable, Continuum Labels for Computer Vision” addresses this challenge of providing what the authors call “continuum labels” - single, real number scores that capture properties observed in videos.</p><p>“Continuum labelling suggests that the boundaries of a particular rating category (e.g., the boundary between a motor ability label of ‘1’ versus ‘2’) can never be exactly determined,” the paper explains.</p><h2 id="traditional-labeling-approaches-face-an-efficiency-consistency-tradeoff">Traditional labeling approaches face an efficiency-consistency tradeoff</h2><p>The problem of labeling videos consistently has traditionally led to an unfortunate tradeoff. Quick methods like assigning numeric scores (0-4) take mere seconds per video but yield inconsistent results between raters. Meanwhile, more consistent methods like pairwise comparison (comparing every possible pair of videos) become impractical as collections grow.</p><p>“Comparing every video to every other in the set of 50 required 1,225 comparisons. Neurologists required between 87 and 146 minutes to rate this set of videos,” the researchers noted. “As the number of comparisons grows quadratically with the number of videos, this is clearly not tractable for even a small video set of 300, which would require 44,850 comparisons, or over 37h of continuous labelling.”</p><p>For real-world applications like medical assessments or sports coaching, this inefficiency renders traditional methods unusable at scale.</p><h2 id="setwise-comparison-dramatically-improves-both-efficiency-and-consistency">Setwise comparison dramatically improves both efficiency and consistency</h2><p>The paper introduces a novel interaction technique called “setwise comparison” that solves this dilemma. Rather than comparing videos in pairs, raters sort small groups (sets) of videos relative to each other. The key innovation combines three elements:</p><ol><li>Human relative judgment capabilities</li><li>A visual interface for comparing multiple videos simultaneously</li><li>The TrueSkill algorithm (originally developed for ranking online gamers)</li></ol><p>The system, called SorTable, presents users with sets of videos as thumbnails. Users can:</p><ul><li>Sort videos from least to greatest severity</li><li>Stack videos they judge to be equal</li><li>Use gestures to compare videos side-by-side</li></ul><p>“Our approach of enforcing which videos were available to compare employs a design-with-intent philosophy,” the researchers explained.</p><p>The real magic happens behind the scenes. Since each set shares some videos with other sets, the TrueSkill algorithm can mathematically combine these partial rankings into a complete ordering of all videos - even inferring comparisons between videos that never appeared together in the same set.</p><h2 id="the-study-found-surprising-improvements-in-both-efficiency-and-consistency">The study found surprising improvements in both efficiency and consistency</h2><p>When eight neurologists tested both methods on a set of 40 patient videos, the results were striking:</p><p>“Setwise comparison was significantly more efficient than pairwise comparison. Task time was reduced by an average of 54 minutes”</p><p>For a modest training set of 400 videos, pairwise comparison would take approximately 100 hours, whereas setwise comparison would take only about 3.5 hours - a dramatic improvement in efficiency.</p><p>But the real surprise was that consistency also improved. The global intraclass correlation coefficient (a measure of agreement between raters from 0 to 1) increased from 0.70 for pairwise comparison to 0.83 for setwise comparison. In medical research, results above 0.8 are considered excellent.</p><p>“We were surprised that setwise comparison was not only more efficient, but also significantly more consistent,” the researchers acknowledged.</p><p>Remarkably, there was no significant difference in cognitive load between the two methods, suggesting that sorting multiple videos wasn’t mentally harder than comparing pairs. Though note, the absence of a significant difference should not be interpreted as evidence of a non-difference.</p><h2 id="different-users-adopted-distinct-sorting-strategies">Different users adopted distinct sorting strategies</h2><p>An interesting finding was that neurologists developed different approaches to the task. Some used an “insertion sort” strategy - viewing many videos first, then relying on memory to place them in order. Others used more of a “bubble sort” approach, making rapid comparisons and swaps between neighboring videos.</p><p>“Some participants viewed a large number of videos and relied on their memory to then sort them, interacting with most videos only once,” the paper explains. “Others did rapid comparisons and swaps of immediate neighbours, bubbling videos to the correct position.”</p><p>Despite these different strategies, all raters achieved similar levels of consistency, suggesting that the system accommodates various cognitive approaches.</p><h2 id="the-implications-extend-beyond-clinical-assessment">The implications extend beyond clinical assessment</h2><p>Although developed for a specific medical application (ASSESS MS), the setwise comparison technique has broad implications for many domains requiring expert judgment of videos on a continuous scale:</p><ul><li>Sports coaching evaluations</li><li>Affect recognition (detecting emotions)</li><li>Movement analysis</li><li>Any domain where experts need to provide consistent ratings</li></ul><p>The study’s limitations include a small sample size of eight neurologists, though this reflects the realistic constraints of specialized expert evaluation. Additionally, the technique was only tested on one type of neurological assessment (the Finger Nose test), and its applicability to other types of video evaluation remains to be confirmed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the improvement in both efficiency and consistency suggests that setwise comparison could transform how videos are labeled for machine learning applications, particularly in specialized fields where expert time is limited and expensive.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Sarkar, A., Morrison, C., Dorn, J.
