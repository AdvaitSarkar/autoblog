Yet this everyday office tool might be the next frontier for musical creativity. A research project called Excello has transformed the humble spreadsheet into a surprising music composition environment.</p><p>The concept leverages a simple truth: spreadsheets are already the world’s most popular programming environment. “There are four times more spreadsheet users than software developers,” the paper notes, making spreadsheets a familiar territory for people who might otherwise be intimidated by traditional music programming languages.</p><p>What makes this approach particularly interesting is how it opens music programming to a broader audience. Traditional music programming environments like ChucK or Sonic Pi offer powerful capabilities but present steep learning curves for newcomers. Spreadsheets, on the other hand, are already familiar to millions.</p><h2 id="turtles-carry-the-melody-through-a-sea-of-cells">Turtles carry the melody through a sea of cells</h2><p>At the heart of Excello’s design is a clever solution to representing time in a two-dimensional grid. Rather than dedicating one axis to time (as most music sequencers do), Excello employs programmable “turtles” that move through the spreadsheet, playing notes as they go.</p><p>These turtles are inspired by turtle graphics from the Logo programming language, where an agent moves around drawing shapes. In Excello, turtles follow paths defined by simple commands, picking up and playing notes placed in cells along their journey.</p><p>“Notes are written using scientific pitch notation (SPN); e.g. F#4 is the F♯ above middle C,” the paper explains. Empty cells or cells containing a period represent rests, while “s” or “-“ instruct the turtle to sustain the previously played note.</p><p>The turtle’s movements are programmed with straightforward commands: “l” and “r” turn the turtle 90 degrees left and right, “n”, “e”, “s” and “w” orient it to specific compass directions, and “m” moves it forward one cell. Numbers can be attached to commands for repetition—“m4” moves forward four cells. Nested commands in parentheses allow for complex patterns.</p><p>A helpful feature is the automatic path length counter. Instead of manually counting cells, users can simply use “m*” to instruct a turtle to move forward as far as there are notes defined in its path, making composition more fluid.</p><h2 id="excello-leverages-familiar-spreadsheet-features-musicians-never-knew-they-needed">Excello leverages familiar spreadsheet features musicians never knew they needed</h2><p>One of Excello’s strengths is how it taps into Excel’s built-in functionality. Cell formatting, copy-paste operations, formula references, and range notation all become tools for musical expression.</p><p>For example, chord input becomes streamlined through a dedicated tool in the interface. When users select cells and choose a chord type, notes are automatically inserted in a pattern that fits the selection—vertically or horizontally. For vertical selections, notes appear from top to bottom in decreasing pitch order, mimicking traditional staff notation.</p><p>Transposition—moving a melody up or down in pitch—is implemented as a spreadsheet function called EXCELLO.MODULATE. This allows users to leverage Excel’s drag-fill functionality to quickly transpose entire sections or build melodies from intervals.</p><p>The power of this approach is demonstrated in the paper’s example of Steve Reich’s “Piano Phase,” a minimalist composition featuring two identical piano melodies playing at slightly different speeds. While other systems require dozens of rows or lines of code to represent this piece, “Excello only requires two cells to define two turtles with different speeds, in addition to the notes.”</p><h2 id="user-testing-shows-excello-compares-favorably-with-professional-notation-software">User testing shows Excello compares favorably with professional notation software</h2><p>To evaluate Excello’s usability, the researchers applied a framework called Cognitive Dimensions of Notations (CDN), which assesses how well information systems support different types of thinking. Nineteen participants used Excello over a 7-8 week period, with their experiences compared against Sibelius, a professional music notation program.</p><p>Significantly, across multiple dimensions—closeness of mapping, consistency, secondary notation, viscosity, and visibility—statistical analysis found no significant differences between Excello and Sibelius. This suggests that despite its unconventional approach, Excello’s notation is just as effective as traditional music software for expressing musical ideas.</p><p>“We found no significant difference between Sibelius and Excello, suggesting Excello’s spreadsheet notation has not compromised the closeness of mapping (to the musical domain) of staff notation,” the study reports.</p><p>Users spent their time differently in each system, with more focus on modification and incrementation in Excello compared to Sibelius. However, both systems involved considerable translation activities—converting musical concepts into notation.</p><h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2><p>While the results appear promising, several limitations should be considered. The study involved a relatively small sample of 21 participants, all university students, which may not represent the broader population of potential users. Additionally, the comparative evaluation focused primarily on Sibelius rather than other music programming environments like ChucK or Sonic Pi, which might be more directly comparable in some respects.</p><p>The seven to eight week usage period, while substantial, may not fully capture how users would incorporate Excello into long-term composition workflows. It’s also unclear how well Excello would handle extremely complex compositions or specialized musical notation beyond the examples demonstrated.</p><p>Furthermore, as a prototype add-in for Microsoft Excel, technical limitations and performance issues might arise when scaling to more complex compositions or real-time performance scenarios.</p><h2 id="spreadsheets-might-be-the-unexpected-future-of-accessible-music-programming">Spreadsheets might be the unexpected future of accessible music programming</h2><p>Despite these limitations, Excello demonstrates that everyday spreadsheet software can become a viable environment for musical creativity. The research highlights how familiar interfaces can be repurposed to lower barriers to entry for creative programming.</p><p>“Excello provides a simple, yet powerful interface for musical composition and programming to the hundreds of millions of users already familiar with the spreadsheet interface,” the paper concludes.</p><p>Future developments might include live editing during playback and visual enhancements to track turtle movements. Given the widespread availability of spreadsheet software, Excello represents an accessible pathway into music programming for people who might otherwise never experiment with algorithmic composition.</p><p>The next time a spreadsheet is opened to crunch numbers, it might also be used to compose the next minimalist masterpiece.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Mattinson, H., &amp; Sarkar, A.
