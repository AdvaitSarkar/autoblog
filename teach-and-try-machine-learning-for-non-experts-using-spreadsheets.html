However, not everyone has the statistical training required to use advanced data analysis tools. This is where the “Teach and Try” technique comes into play. This tool allows users to perform complex data modelling tasks using a simple spreadsheet interface.</p><p>Traditional data analysis tools, such as programming languages like R and specialised software packages like scikit-learn, require a deep understanding of statistics and programming. This creates a barrier for many users who need to perform data analysis but lack the necessary skills. The “Teach and Try” technique aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly interface that leverages familiar spreadsheet operations.</p><h2 id="how-the-teach-and-try-technique-works">How the Teach and Try Technique Works</h2><p>The “Teach and Try” technique is built on a simple interaction paradigm. Users mark a range of cells in a spreadsheet to indicate their confidence in those values. These marked cells are then used to train a statistical model. Once the training set is specified, users can select another range of cells to apply the model. If the selected cells are empty, the model’s predictions populate them. If the cells already contain values, they are coloured according to their deviation from the model’s predictions.</p><p>The paper explains, “Users mark a range of cells to indicate that they have confidence in those values. The marked cells are used to train a statistical model. Once the training set has been specified in this manner, the user can select any other range of cells, potentially overlapping with the training set, in order to apply the model to those cells”.</p><h2 id="a-practical-example-grading-students">A Practical Example: Grading Students</h2><p>To illustrate the technique, consider a scenario where a maths teacher is grading students based on their exam scores. The teacher marks the scores and corresponding grades for a subset of students. The “Teach and Try” tool uses this data to build a model. The teacher can then apply this model to grade the remaining students. If the grades are missing, the tool fills them in. If the grades are already present, the tool highlights any discrepancies.</p><p>The paper provides a detailed example: “The first column is their score, and the second column is their grade. A score of 75 or above gets an A, 50 to 74 gets B, and 49 or below gets C. Some of the Grade column is pre-populated, and the participants were asked to use the software to ‘quickly grade the remaining students’”.</p><h2 id="experimenting-with-the-teach-and-try-technique">Experimenting with the Teach and Try Technique</h2><p>An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the “Teach and Try” technique. The study involved 21 participants, including administrative staff from the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory and BT Research. Most (62%) of the participants “had no prior experience with either machine learning or statistical modelling, but had a basic familiarity with spreadsheet environments.” Each participant completed four statistical tasks using the Teach and Try tool.</p><p>The study found no significant difference in task durations between the experienced and inexperienced participants. Additionally, the second task of any type (filling or evaluation) took less time than the first task, indicating that users quickly learned how to use the tool.</p><h2 id="understanding-statistical-concepts">Understanding Statistical Concepts</h2><p>Participants developed a nontrivial understanding of how the software works. When asked how the computer might be performing the tasks, participants used various explanations, including mathematical terminology, technical constructs, case-based reasoning, and abstract non-technical terms. This demonstrates that users gained a sufficient appreciation of the machine learning paradigm to use the tool confidently.</p><p>The paper notes, “Participants used mathematical terminology to describe their understanding of the software, guessing that it was ‘solving a system of linear equations’, ‘finding some sort of correlation’, or ‘plotting a graph’”. Additionally, some participants explained the software’s behaviour in terms of technology they were familiar with, such as “constructing complicated spreadsheet formulae, SQL queries or conditional formatting rules”.</p><h2 id="usability-challenges-and-improvements">Usability Challenges and Improvements</h2><p>While the “Teach” action was intuitive, some participants initially misunderstood the “Try” action. Common errors included selecting all cells in the target rows or all cells except the target column. Future work might explore alternative labels, such as “Train” and “Test”, to improve usability.</p><p>The paper highlights, “Some participants initially misunderstood how the selection bounds for the ‘Try’ action were being interpreted. The most common error was to select all the cells in the target rows, because they had done exactly that for the ‘Teach’ action”.</p><h2 id="related-work-and-distinctions">Related Work and Distinctions</h2><p>The “Teach and Try” technique shares similarities with other tools, such as WYSIWYT and the Oracle Spreadsheet add-in for Predictive Analytics. However, it distinguishes itself by allowing users without statistical knowledge to build and apply statistical models directly within a spreadsheet interface.</p><p>The paper states, “WYSIWYT allows users without spreadsheet programming knowledge to debug their data, whereas our system allows users without statistical knowledge to build and apply statistical models”.</p><h2 id="conclusion-making-data-analysis-accessible">Conclusion: Making Data Analysis Accessible</h2><p>The “Teach and Try” technique represents a significant step towards making advanced analytical techniques accessible to end-users with no statistical training. By leveraging familiar spreadsheet operations, this tool empowers users to perform complex data modelling tasks and gain a better understanding of exploratory data analysis methods.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Sarkar, A., Blackwell, A.
