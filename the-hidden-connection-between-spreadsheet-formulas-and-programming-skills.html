The researchers found that while general spreadsheet experience doesn’t correlate with programming experience, expertise in spreadsheet formulas does show a significant correlation with programming skills. This suggests interesting connections between different forms of computational thinking that might not be immediately obvious to casual spreadsheet users.</p><p>Reference: Sarkar, A., Borghouts, J.

You’re staring at a spreadsheet, trying to figure out how to get that column to calculate the thing you need. Maybe you’re creating a budget, tracking inventory, or analyzing sales figures. Then comes the moment of truth: writing a formula.</p><p>For some, this is where the cold sweat begins. For others, it’s a satisfying puzzle to solve. But what if these spreadsheet skills are more significant than we realize? What if they’re actually building programming muscles we didn’t know we had?</p><p>A recent study explored exactly this question, examining the relationship between spreadsheet experience and programming knowledge. The findings reveal something that might change how we think about those Excel skills on our resumes.</p><h2 id="formula-experts-are-more-likely-to-be-programmers-too">Formula experts are more likely to be programmers too</h2><p>The most intriguing discovery from this research is straightforward: people who report high expertise with spreadsheet formulas are significantly more likely to also have experience with traditional programming languages like Python, Java, or JavaScript.</p><p>“We find that formula experience and programming experience are positively correlated (Spearman’s rs = 0.42, p = 2.6 · 10^-3),” the paper reports. This statistical relationship suggests that these seemingly different skills might be more connected than previously thought.</p><p>But here’s the twist. General spreadsheet experience (how comfortable you are with spreadsheets overall) doesn’t show the same strong correlation with programming experience. You can be a spreadsheet wizard without necessarily knowing how to code.</p><p>What’s happening here? The researchers propose several explanations. Perhaps people who already know how to program find it easier to learn formula writing. After all, research shows that “acquiring expertise in a second programming language is considerably easier than the first, due to the pre-existence of suitable mental models.”</p><p>Or maybe it works the other way around. Perhaps those who master spreadsheet formulas develop mental frameworks that make traditional programming more accessible.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters-in-todays-computational-world">Why this matters in today’s computational world</h2><p>This finding arrives at a pivotal moment. Coding education is expanding rapidly, from elementary school curriculums to workplace upskilling programs. The researchers note this shift: “It is increasingly common for people to acquire formal experience in computing and programming, whether it is through a computing curriculum at school, after school code clubs, or at university.”</p><p>Yet spreadsheets remain one of the most widespread computational tools in the workplace. They’re the silent workhorses of global business, used by everyone from administrative assistants to CEOs. Understanding how spreadsheet skills relate to broader programming knowledge could reshape how we think about digital literacy and workplace training.</p><p>Consider the implications. If formula expertise transfers to programming skills, then the millions of spreadsheet users worldwide might be developing valuable computational thinking abilities without even realizing it. Spreadsheets could be the unsung heroes of computational literacy.</p><h2 id="the-science-of-measuring-expertise-isnt-straightforward">The science of measuring expertise isn’t straightforward</h2><p>Before getting too excited about these findings, some caution is warranted. The study had limitations that are worth considering.</p><p>The sample size was relatively small (49 participants after excluding underrepresented groups) and recruited through convenience and snowball sampling methods. This means the participants were likely not representative of the global population of spreadsheet users.</p><p>Additionally, the expertise measurements relied on self-reporting, which introduces its own uncertainties. As the paper acknowledges, “Self-reported experience measures do have the limitation that respondents may give levels different interpretations; respondents with lower experience may inadvertently place themselves on a higher experience level… and respondents with higher experience may rate themselves lower due to greater self-awareness or modesty.”</p><p>The researchers were careful not to draw population-level conclusions because of these limitations. Instead, they focused on exploring correlations within their specific sample.</p><h2 id="your-spreadsheet-skills-might-reveal-hidden-programming-potential">Your spreadsheet skills might reveal hidden programming potential</h2><p>What does this mean for the average spreadsheet user? Perhaps those complex formulas you’ve struggled to master are actually preparing you for a wider world of programming possibilities.</p><p>The paper suggests that certain personality traits might drive both formula and programming expertise: “Aghaee et al. have provided a personality-based account for intrinsic motivation in end-user programming. In particular, their research shows that certain personality profiles (which may be characterised as artistry, bricoleurism, and technophilia) are intrinsically predisposed to programming.”</p><p>In other words, if you enjoy tinkering with spreadsheet formulas, you might have an untapped affinity for programming. That =VLOOKUP() you mastered last week could be signaling latent coding abilities.</p><h2 id="spreadsheet-users-follow-diverse-paths-to-expertise">Spreadsheet users follow diverse paths to expertise</h2><p>Another interesting finding is the diversity in how people use spreadsheets. Some participants were highly experienced but used spreadsheets primarily for simpler tasks like maintaining lists or tracking data, tasks that require little formula use.</p><p>“It is possible, therefore, to have high levels of experience using spreadsheets in this manner, without necessarily acquiring expertise in formula authoring (and by extension, in programming),” the researchers note.</p><p>This diversity extends to how people learn spreadsheet skills. Previous research cited in the paper indicates that “spreadsheet learning tends to be goal-driven rather than structured,” and that users often learn “socially through colleagues” rather than through formal training. This informal learning pattern contrasts with traditional programming education, which often follows more structured paths.</p><p>The survey adds to growing evidence that our computational skills develop in complex, interconnected ways. The boundaries between “user” and “programmer” might be fuzzier than we’ve traditionally believed.</p><p>Next time you’re wrestling with a complex spreadsheet formula, take a moment to appreciate that you might be developing skills that extend far beyond that single Excel file. Those formula-writing muscles could be preparing you for a broader computational future.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Sarkar, A., Borghouts, J.
