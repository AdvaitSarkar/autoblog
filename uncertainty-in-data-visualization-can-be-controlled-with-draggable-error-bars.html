Breaking down the results from a 2015 paper, it demonstrates how this intuitive interface enables users to make informed decisions about the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resources.

A clever solution has been developing in recent years - approximate computation techniques that provide fast results with quantifiable error bounds. These techniques are gaining traction, but they introduce a new problem: how do users interact with and understand the uncertainty these approximations create?</p><p>“With the emergence of approximate computation techniques, we now have sources of uncertainty that make a trade-off between accuracy and time/space resources,” notes the paper from the 2015 Eurographics Conference on Visualization. This represents a fundamental shift in how we think about uncertainty in data visualization.</p><p>Traditionally, uncertainty has been treated as a fixed property of data - something inherent that we simply need to represent. But with new approximate computation techniques, uncertainty becomes something that can be manipulated and controlled, just like any other aspect of a visualization.</p><h2 id="draggable-error-bars-offer-an-intuitive-way-to-control-uncertainty">Draggable error bars offer an intuitive way to control uncertainty</h2><p>The paper introduces a novel solution: draggable error bars. This direct-manipulation interface allows users to literally grab and adjust the level of uncertainty they’re willing to accept in a visualization.</p><p>The interface is simple. Error bars represent the uncertainty in data points, and users can drag these bars to reduce uncertainty. When dragging, a horizontal indicator appears, showing the estimated time required for recomputation. This “resource cost estimation bar” is crucial - it helps users decide whether the increased accuracy is worth the computational cost.</p><p>“When dragging, a horizontal indicator bar appears, visualising the estimated duration of recomputation,” the paper explains. “This ‘resource cost estimation bar’ is an essential component of the interface, as it allows the user to judge whether they are willing to invest their resources (in this case, time) in exchange for an improvement in accuracy.”</p><p>Upon releasing the mouse button, the recomputation begins. The cost estimation indicator shrinks as the computation progresses, and the data point and error bars move to their newly accurate positions.</p><p>This interface can be applied to various types of charts, including scatterplots, bar charts, and line graphs. It works with multiple approximate computation techniques like sampling, sketching, and online aggregation.</p><h2 id="people-can-spontaneously-discover-how-to-use-the-interface">People can spontaneously discover how to use the interface</h2><p>But does this interface actually work for users? To find out, the researchers conducted a web-based study with 39 participants.</p><p>The results were encouraging. When asked to reduce the uncertainty associated with a point on a plot, 87% of participants successfully discovered the drag operation without any instructions. The median discovery time was just 19.3 seconds. This suggests the interface aligns well with users’ intuitive expectations about how to manipulate uncertainty.</p><p>“From this we conclude that the interface corresponds well with users’ prior assumptions about how one might manipulate uncertainty in a visualisation, i.e., it is intuitive,” states the paper.</p><h2 id="users-make-strategic-decisions-about-uncertainty-based-on-computation-time">Users make strategic decisions about uncertainty based on computation time</h2><p>After being given a full explanation of the interface, participants were asked to perform 30 comparison tasks, each involving two data points with error bars. Although it was always possible to give a reasonable interpretation without interacting with the error bars, 77% of participants chose to use drag operations.</p><p>Some participants (13 out of 39) used drag operations in all 30 tasks, averaging 2.53 drags per task. On average, they reduced uncertainty by 67.6% per drag. This demonstrates that participants found value in manipulating uncertainty rather than just accepting it as a fixed property.</p><p>What’s particularly interesting is how participants adapted their behavior based on recomputation time. There was a clear negative correlation between maximum recompute time and uncertainty reduced per drag per task. In other words, when recomputation was expensive (time-consuming), participants preferred to make multiple small adjustments rather than one large one.</p><p>“This corresponds to behaviour observed in our pilot studies where participants preferred to make multiple small drags if recomputation was expensive,” the paper notes.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-interactive-uncertainty-visualization-looks-promising">The future of interactive uncertainty visualization looks promising</h2><p>The implications of this research extend beyond just this specific interface. As approximate computation becomes more common in data analysis, interfaces that allow direct manipulation of uncertainty will become increasingly important.</p><p>This research demonstrates that users can understand and effectively use such interfaces. They can make informed decisions about the trade-offs between accuracy and computational resources, adapting their behavior based on these trade-offs.</p><p>The study shows a path forward for interactive visualization of large datasets. Instead of treating uncertainty as an undesirable but unavoidable aspect of data visualization, we can embrace it as a parameter that users can control.</p><p>“Our study provides evidence that the representation of required computational resources modulates interaction as intended, allowing skilled users to modify their usage to achieve the resource/accuracy tradeoff that suits their needs,” concludes the paper.</p><p>For data scientists and analysts working with increasingly large datasets, this approach offers a promising new way to interact with data. Rather than waiting for complete, exact computations or accepting highly uncertain approximations, users can actively participate in deciding what level of uncertainty is acceptable for their specific needs.</p><p>This represents a shift from passive consumption of visualizations to active engagement with the underlying computational processes - a shift that could make large-scale data analysis more accessible and effective.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Sarkar, A., Blackwell, A.
