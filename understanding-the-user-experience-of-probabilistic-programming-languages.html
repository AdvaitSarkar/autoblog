The paper brings together perspectives from psychology of programming, educational approaches, and end-user development to address how PPLs might reach broader audiences.</p><p>Reference: Blackwell, A., Church, L., Erwig, M., Geddes, J., Gordon, A., Gorinova, M., Gunes Baydin, A., Gram-Hansen, B., Kohn, T., Lawrence, N., Mansinghka, V., Paige, B., Petricek, T., Robinson, D., Sarkar, A., &amp; Strickson, O. (2019). Usability of probabilistic programming languages. In Proceedings of the 30th Annual Conference of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG 2019).</p><h2 id="what-makes-programming-with-uncertainty-so-challenging-for-humans">What Makes Programming with Uncertainty So Challenging for Humans</h2><p>The world runs on probability, not certainty. From weather forecasts to medical diagnoses, we constantly navigate through uncertainties. Yet the tools designed to handle these probabilities remain largely inaccessible to anyone without specialized training.</p><p>Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) represent a powerful paradigm for modeling uncertainty and making data-driven inferences. Unlike conventional programming where variables have fixed values, PPLs treat variables as probability distributions. This fundamental shift creates unique usability challenges for programmers and potential users.</p><p>“A key distinction in relation to conventional programming languages is that variables do not have a single value, but should be regarded as defining (or sampling from) a probability distribution of likely values,” the paper explains. This concept alone represents a significant mental hurdle for many learners.</p><p>Consider how we typically learn to program: variables hold specific values that change in predictable ways. PPLs flip this understanding on its head, asking programmers to think in terms of distributions and possibilities rather than deterministic outcomes.</p><h2 id="the-gap-between-statisticians-and-everyday-users-continues-to-widen">The Gap Between Statisticians and Everyday Users Continues to Widen</h2><p>While artificial intelligence and data science have entered mainstream consciousness, the tools needed to work with probabilistic models remain largely restricted to specialists. The paper highlights this gap by drawing a parallel with spreadsheets, noting that “more people create programs in spreadsheets such as Excel than in all other programming languages combined.”</p><p>This comparison is telling. Spreadsheets succeeded because they offer a concrete perspective on the user’s data rather than focusing on programming abstractions. Could a similar approach work for probabilistic programming?</p><p>The answer might lie in creating interfaces that bridge the conceptual gap between everyday understanding and the mathematical formalism of probability theory. For instance, visualizing probability distributions could help users grasp these abstract concepts without requiring deep statistical knowledge.</p><h2 id="visual-metaphors-could-transform-how-we-understand-probability">Visual Metaphors Could Transform How We Understand Probability</h2><p>One promising approach detailed in the paper involves using spatial partitions as a visual metaphor for understanding probabilistic values. Instead of writing complex mathematical notation, users could interact with visual blocks representing probability distributions.</p><p>“Spatial partitions can serve as a simple visual metaphor for illustrating discrete probabilistic values,” the authors propose, describing a system where the area occupied by each value corresponds to its probability. This approach makes tangible what is otherwise highly abstract.</p><p>Imagine seeing a fair coin toss represented as two equal rectangles labeled “Heads” and “Tails,” each occupying 50% of the space. Now imagine combining this with another random event, like drawing a colored ball from an urn. The visual representation would show how these probabilities interact, making complex concepts like conditional probability more intuitive.</p><p>Such visualizations could transform how probability is taught in schools and how probabilistic models are created in practical applications. They provide an entry point for those who might otherwise be intimidated by the mathematical formalism.</p><h2 id="end-user-development-could-democratize-data-science-skills">End-User Development Could Democratize Data Science Skills</h2><p>The paper makes a compelling case for considering PPLs from an end-user development perspective. End-user developers are people who create programs to solve practical problems rather than out of technical interest or as professional programmers.</p><p>“Increased business interest in the methods of statistical data science suggests that these end-users are likely to find value in PPL capabilities,” the paper states, especially if these capabilities are presented in familiar contexts like spreadsheets.</p><p>This approach could change how people interact with data. Rather than treating data wrangling, modeling, and analysis as separate steps, an integrated approach could allow users to explore data and build models simultaneously, gaining insights through iterative experimentation.</p><p>The authors describe a project called “nocell” where “the result of running a program written in this language is a spreadsheet model applied to the input data.” This bridges sophisticated probabilistic modeling with the familiarity of spreadsheets, potentially opening the door for many more people to engage with data science.</p><h2 id="educational-approaches-should-consider-diverse-learning-needs">Educational Approaches Should Consider Diverse Learning Needs</h2><p>The paper also considers how PPLs might be used in education, drawing inspiration from languages like Scratch that have successfully introduced programming concepts to children.</p><p>“Much traditional teaching of probability follows the traditions of Bayes himself, and other early theorists, in exploring the mathematical implications of gambling (coin tosses, dice throws etc),” the authors note. But contemporary problems in data science might prove more motivating for today’s learners.</p><p>Imagine students using probabilistic programming to analyze traffic data near their school, or to explore patterns in social media. These real-world applications could make abstract concepts tangible and relevant, fostering deeper understanding.</p><p>The authors suggest that visual representations of models could be particularly valuable for learning. Studies show that when users can see visualizations of Bayesian networks alongside code, they develop higher-level understanding of model dependencies rather than focusing solely on implementation details.</p><h2 id="limitations-and-future-directions-for-ppl-research">Limitations and Future Directions for PPL Research</h2><p>While the paper presents promising approaches to making PPLs more usable, several limitations should be noted. The visualizations described are primarily focused on discrete probability distributions and may not scale well to more complex models. Additionally, the educational benefits of these approaches remain theoretical until more extensive classroom studies are conducted.</p><p>The paper represents a starting point for discussion rather than presenting definitive solutions. “This paper should primarily be regarded as a manifesto for promising research directions in the development of more usable PPLs,” the authors explicitly state.</p><p>Future research will need to address how these approaches scale to real-world problems, how different user groups interact with probabilistic concepts, and what specific design patterns prove most effective for various applications.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Blackwell, A., Church, L., Erwig, M., Geddes, J., Gordon, A., Gorinova, M., Gunes Baydin, A., Gram-Hansen, B., Kohn, T., Lawrence, N., Mansinghka, V., Paige, B., Petricek, T., Robinson, D., Sarkar, A., &amp; Strickson, O.
