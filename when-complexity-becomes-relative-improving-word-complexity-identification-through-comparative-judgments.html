The study demonstrates that having annotators rank words by complexity rather than simply labeling them as “complex” or “not complex” yields higher agreement and potentially more efficient data collection.</p><p>Reference: Gooding, S., Kochmar, E., Sarkar, A., &amp; Blackwell, A. (2019). Comparative judgments are more consistent than binary classification for labelling word complexity. In Proceedings of the 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop (pp. 208–214).

You encounter words like “ameliorate,” “politicizing,” or “substantively.” For many readers, especially those learning English or with reading difficulties, these words create barriers to understanding.</p><p>This is where lexical simplification comes in. It’s the process of replacing difficult words with simpler alternatives while preserving meaning. For example, changing “ameliorate” to “improve” or “substantively” to “significantly.” But before computers can help simplify text automatically, they need to learn which words actually need simplification in context.</p><p>The first crucial step in this process is called Complex Word Identification (CWI). It’s the foundation of any good text simplification system.</p><p>“Lexical simplification can be framed as a two step procedure, where the algorithm needs to first identify which words (or more specifically word senses) in context require simplification, and then replace them with simpler alternatives,” explains the paper. “The first step is commonly referred to as complex word identification.”</p><p>But teaching computers to recognize complex words isn’t straightforward. Humans need to provide examples by labeling words in text as either complex or not complex. These labeled examples then train machine learning models to make predictions about new words. However, previous attempts at creating such datasets have suffered from a significant problem: people often disagree about what makes a word complex.</p><h2 id="previous-complex-word-identification-efforts-have-shown-poor-annotator-agreement">Previous complex word identification efforts have shown poor annotator agreement</h2><p>When multiple people label the same data, researchers want to see high “inter-annotator agreement” – a measure of how consistently different people apply the same labels. Previous complex word identification datasets have shown remarkably low agreement.</p><p>In one dataset from 2012, the agreement score (measured using Cohen’s Kappa) was just 0.398. Another from 2016 had an even lower score (Krippendorff’s Alpha) of 0.244. A third dataset from 2018 found that only 1.1% of words were unanimously marked as complex by all 20 annotators. According to standard interpretations of these metrics, these scores represent “minimal agreement” or “inconclusive” results.</p><p>Why so much disagreement? Word complexity is inherently subjective. What seems complex depends on your vocabulary, education, native language, age, and many other factors. Previous annotation efforts did not control for these variables.</p><p>“The homogeneity of the annotator group is usually not controlled for, meaning that labels are provided by individuals with various backgrounds, conflating factors such as age, native language and education,” notes the paper.</p><p>Additionally, these studies forced annotators to make binary decisions about word complexity, but complexity exists on a spectrum. A word isn’t simply “complex” or “not complex” – it can be “somewhat complex” or “very complex” relative to other words.</p><h2 id="comparative-judgments-produce-more-consistent-annotations-than-binary-classifications">Comparative judgments produce more consistent annotations than binary classifications</h2><p>The researchers set out to test whether a different approach could yield better results. They recruited 30 annotators who shared similar backgrounds: all were native English speakers, had graduate degrees, and were between 21-30 years old. Each person completed two different annotation tasks using words selected from previous datasets.</p><p>In the first task, annotators used a traditional binary approach – clicking on words they considered complex. In the second task, they ranked words according to their relative complexity. The results were clear: comparative judgments produced significantly higher agreement.</p><p>“Using the Kappa interpretations, the comparative (ranking) labelling task has a moderate level of agreement, whereas the agreement in the binary annotation task is minimal, showing that the comparative judgment leads to a higher level of agreement than the binary categorisation judgment,” reports the paper.</p><p>The agreement scores for the ranking task reached 0.6775 (Kappa) and 0.6821 (Alpha) – well above the threshold considered reliable for drawing conclusions. By comparison, the binary task scores were much lower: 0.3937 (Kappa) and 0.4960 (Alpha).</p><h2 id="ranking-words-by-complexity-is-faster-than-binary-classification">Ranking words by complexity is faster than binary classification</h2><p>Beyond producing more consistent annotations, the comparative approach also proved more efficient. Annotators completed the ranking task in 28.77 seconds per sentence on average, compared to 38.69 seconds for the binary task – nearly 10 seconds faster per sentence.</p><p>“Whilst this is partly expected due to the complex words being pre-selected, the annotator is still required to read and consider the words within context,” explains the paper. “These results suggest that ranking is a more efficient mechanism for collecting complex word annotations that results in a higher annotator reliability than traditional approaches.”</p><p>This efficiency gain could translate to significant time savings when creating large datasets needed for training machine learning models.</p><h2 id="homogeneous-annotator-groups-may-contribute-to-better-agreement">Homogeneous annotator groups may contribute to better agreement</h2><p>While the primary focus of the study was comparing binary versus comparative judgments, another interesting finding emerged. Even the binary classification task in this study showed higher agreement (Alpha = 0.496) than previous binary annotation efforts (Alpha = 0.244).</p><p>The researchers suggest this improvement may stem from using a more homogeneous group of annotators who share similar language backgrounds, education levels, and ages. When people have similar reference points for judging complexity, they’re more likely to agree.</p><p>“This supports the case that the concept of word complexity, and thus the level of agreement, is aligned between individuals that share a common background,” notes the paper.</p><h2 id="comparative-judgments-could-improve-machine-learning-for-subjective-concepts">Comparative judgments could improve machine learning for subjective concepts</h2><p>The implications of this research extend beyond complex word identification. Many machine learning tasks involve subjective human experiences that exist on a continuum rather than in distinct categories – things like humor, emotion, or aesthetic quality.</p><p>“Comparative labels are used relatively rarely in ML research at present, but our results suggest that this may be a more reliable basis for training such models in future, especially where the phenomenon to be modelled relies on human experience,” the researchers conclude.</p><p>Another advantage of the ranking approach is that it can generate more labeled data without additional annotation effort. When words are ranked by complexity, relationships between all words in the ranking can be inferred, providing more training signal for machine learning models.</p><p>It should be noted that this study has some limitations. The sample size of 30 annotators was relatively small, and the experiment focused on a homogeneous group of native English speakers with graduate degrees. Future research should explore whether similar results hold for other demographic groups and annotation tasks.</p><p>Nevertheless, the findings suggest a promising direction for improving the quality and efficiency of human annotations for machine learning, particularly for subjective concepts that resist simple binary classification.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Gooding, S., Kochmar, E., Sarkar, A., &amp; Blackwell, A.
