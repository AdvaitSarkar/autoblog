The researchers tested this hypothesis using an interactive language learning game in a 3D blocks world, finding that restricting communication to predefined tokens led to better task performance and improved user experience metrics.</p><p>Reference: Mu, J., &amp; Sarkar, A. (2019). Do we need natural language?: Exploring restricted language interfaces for complex domains. In Extended Abstracts of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA ‘19) (pp. LBW2822:1–LBW2822:6). ACM. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3290607.3312975">https://doi.org/10.1145/3290607.3312975</a></p><h2 id="natural-language-interfaces-promise-simplicity-but-often-frustrate-users">Natural language interfaces promise simplicity but often frustrate users</h2><p>We’ve all been there. “Alexa, play that song about rivers and roads.” <em>Confused robot noises.</em> “Alexa, play that song… you know… RIVERS AND ROADS?” <em>Alexa plays ‘Old Town Road’</em></p><p>The promise of natural language interfaces (NLIs) - systems where humans can talk to computers using everyday language - seems like the pinnacle of intuitive design. Just tell the computer what you want in your own words! No learning curve! No manuals!</p><p>But the reality often fails to match this promise. Current natural language systems frequently misunderstand users, leading to frustration and disappointment. As the paper notes, “several studies have demonstrated worrying user experience issues with current-generation personal assistants due to mismatches between user expectations and system capabilities.”</p><p>The fundamental problem is that truly understanding human language remains extraordinarily difficult for computers. When an interface suggests you can communicate naturally, it creates expectations that the system may not be able to fulfill.</p><h2 id="the-experiment-used-a-blocks-world-game-to-test-restricted-versus-unrestricted-language">The experiment used a blocks-world game to test restricted versus unrestricted language</h2><p>To test whether restricting user language might actually improve experience, the researchers employed an interactive language learning game called SHRDLURN (a nod to the classic SHRDLU system from the 1970s). In this game, users need to manipulate colored blocks from a starting configuration to a goal configuration by issuing text commands to the computer.</p><p>The game was intentionally designed so users would need to develop a communication system with the computer from scratch. The computer uses a learning algorithm to interpret commands, improving its understanding as more commands are issued.</p><p>Participants were split into two groups:</p><ul><li>An unrestricted group who could type any commands they wanted</li><li>A restricted group who could only use 11 specific tokens matching the system’s internal logical primitives (all, cyan, red, brown, orange, except, leftmost, rightmost, add, remove, to)</li></ul><p>What makes this setup fascinating is that it mirrors many real-world interactions with digital assistants, where the underlying capability of the system is hidden, and users must build a mental model of what the system can understand.</p><h2 id="restricted-language-led-to-better-performance-and-reduced-mental-effort">Restricted language led to better performance and reduced mental effort</h2><p>Counter to what many would expect, constraining users to a limited vocabulary resulted in the same or better task performance. Restricted participants needed an average of 7.63 scrolls per utterance, compared to unrestricted users’ 12.9 scrolls (scrolling was necessary when the computer misunderstood the command). Though the difference wasn’t statistically significant (p = 0.13), the trend favored the restricted condition.</p><p>More striking were the differences in user experience. On NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) measurements, restricted users reported:</p><ul><li>Significantly less required effort (48.8 vs 72.5, p = 0.014)</li><li>Significantly higher perceived performance (66.9 vs 39.4, p = 0.005)</li><li>Lower mental demand (54.4 vs 75.6, p = 0.06, marginally significant)</li></ul><p>Frustration levels were similar between groups, suggesting that the restrictions didn’t annoy users as one might expect.</p><h2 id="users-naturally-gravitating-to-simpler-language-performed-better">Users naturally gravitating to simpler language performed better</h2><p>Perhaps the most telling finding came from analyzing the communication strategies of participants in the unrestricted condition. The most successful unrestricted users independently developed simple, consistent languages resembling the restricted condition.</p><p>The paper provides examples contrasting successful and unsuccessful users:</p><pre><code>Player 1/8 (Mean scrolls/utterance: 4.08)
add blue blocks to blue blocks
add red block on the last orange stack
remove last red block
remove top orange blocks
remove first red block

Player 8/8 (Mean scrolls/utterance: 28.9)
move nothing
move all but blue
move all but red
remove 5th
remove first
</code></pre><p>The high-performing player used a consistent pattern of commands, while the struggling player employed inconsistent terminology and structure. This suggests that even when given free rein, users who naturally adopt simpler, more structured communication fare better.</p><h2 id="the-implications-extend-to-real-world-interface-design">The implications extend to real-world interface design</h2><p>The results suggest an interesting middle ground for interface design. Rather than choosing between fully natural language (which is hard to build and creates unrealistic expectations) or traditional interfaces (which require learning curves), a “restricted language interface” might offer the best of both worlds.</p><p>“More generally, rather than considering only two extremes—a specialized programming language or GUI versus a human-level language understanding system—designers should consider ‘restricted’ language interfaces which trade off full expressivity for simplicity, learnability, and consistency,” the paper argues.</p><p>This approach could be particularly valuable for domains with well-defined action spaces, like data analysis, database querying, or robot control. By guiding users toward consistent language patterns that match what the system can understand, designers might create interfaces that not only perform better but also feel better to use.</p><h2 id="the-limitations-suggest-caution-when-generalizing-these-findings">The limitations suggest caution when generalizing these findings</h2><p>The study comes with important caveats. The findings apply primarily to text-based interfaces rather than voice, since text input “is more amenable to restriction and shorthand than voice communication.” The results may also be limited to well-specified domains with finite action spaces, unlike open-ended tasks such as general conversation or answering arbitrary questions.</p><p>The sample size was relatively small (16 participants), and the experimental task was quite specific. Additionally, the blocks world represents a simplified environment compared to many real-world applications.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study offers a fascinating counterpoint to the assumption that more freedom in language interfaces always leads to better experiences. Sometimes, a little structure goes a long way.</p><p>For designers of conversational interfaces, the message is clear: don’t try to boil the ocean by supporting every possible way a human might express a command. Instead, consider how to subtly guide users toward language patterns the system can reliably interpret. This guidance might not only make the system easier to build, but also more satisfying to use.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Mu, J., &amp; Sarkar, A. (2019).
