The paper introduces “SheetMusic,” a prototype that integrates musical sound effects into the familiar spreadsheet environment, examining whether such a tool should be considered a musical instrument, a programming language, or both.</p><p><strong>Reference</strong>: Sarkar, A. (2016, September). <em>Towards spreadsheet tools for end-user music programming</em>. In <em>Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG 2016)</em> (pp. 228–231).</p><h2 id="spreadsheets-are-musical-instruments-waiting-to-happen">Spreadsheets Are Musical Instruments Waiting to Happen</h2><p>The humble spreadsheet, typically associated with accounting and data analysis, has a secret musical talent that few have recognized. A prototype called “SheetMusic” reveals that beneath the rows and columns of traditional spreadsheets lies potential for creating and manipulating sound in ways that could transform both music composition and data analysis.</p><p>At first glance, SheetMusic looks like any standard spreadsheet application. However, it harbors special functions that allow users to generate musical notes and sequences directly from cells. For example, typing “p(‘c 5’)” plays a single note, while “s([‘c 5’, ‘g 4’, ‘a 4’, ‘e 4’], 1)” plays a sequence of notes.</p><p>“Apart from the play/pause controls, it is largely indistinguishable from a regular spreadsheet,” the paper notes. This familiarity is intentional, leveraging the widespread comfort many non-programmers have with spreadsheet environments.</p><p>This approach sits at the intersection of music and programming. SheetMusic allows users to create simple drum beats with formulas like “if(tick%2==0) p(‘snare’) else p(‘kick’)” which alternates between snare and kick drum sounds on each “tick” or beat.</p><h2 id="the-spreadsheet-format-offers-two-key-advantages-for-musical-coding">The Spreadsheet Format Offers Two Key Advantages for Musical Coding</h2><p>The grid-based layout of spreadsheets provides unique benefits that other programming environments might not. According to the paper, “The spreadsheet paradigm is well-known to be an excellent interface for novice end-user programming.” This accessibility means people without formal programming training can create musical compositions through a familiar interface.</p><p>Additionally, the grid format enables what programmers call “rich secondary notation” through cell layout. Users can organize related musical elements visually by grouping them together, separating them with blank cells, or highlighting them with different colors. This visual organization helps create intuitive structure without affecting how the program actually runs.</p><p>The combination of these advantages makes spreadsheets a potentially powerful platform for people to experiment with programmable music without the steep learning curve associated with traditional music programming languages.</p><h2 id="is-sheetmusic-an-instrument-or-a-programming-language">Is SheetMusic an Instrument or a Programming Language?</h2><p>The distinction between musical instruments and programming languages becomes blurry when examining tools like SheetMusic. The paper addresses this directly: “A central design question is whether SheetMusic is intended as a composition tool, a musical instrument, or a programming language.”</p><p>This question gets to the heart of how we define musical instruments in the digital age. The paper argues that “the defining characteristic of a musical instrument is a player with intent and agency to musically affect the output of the instrument.” Under this definition, programming environments can indeed function as instruments when users actively manipulate them to create sound.</p><p>What distinguishes SheetMusic from both traditional instruments and simple music playback is its ability to create “music as an interactive, reactive, data-dependent experience.” Unlike a piano that plays the note you press, or a recorded song that plays the same way each time, SheetMusic can generate music that responds to changing data or conditions.</p><h2 id="data-sonification-makes-spreadsheet-information-audible-and-accessible">Data Sonification Makes Spreadsheet Information Audible and Accessible</h2><p>One practical application of SheetMusic lies in data sonification, the process of converting data into sound. The paper suggests that “a few SheetMusic formulae could instantly create ‘auditory scatterplots’ or line graphs, where data values are mapped to pitches and played in rapid succession.”</p><p>This approach has been “known to be highly perceptually effective for several types of analysis,” according to the paper. Imagine hearing stock market trends as rising and falling pitches, or rainfall patterns translated into rhythmic intensity. Such auditory representations can reveal patterns that might be missed in visual analyses alone.</p><p>This capability also improves accessibility for visually impaired users, who could hear data trends rather than needing to see them on a chart or graph. The paper highlights that pitch mappings could be “tailored specifically to the data domain,” such as changing octaves or keys at important thresholds within the data.</p><h2 id="time-flows-differently-in-musical-spreadsheets">Time Flows Differently in Musical Spreadsheets</h2><p>Traditional musical notation and digital sequencers typically represent time explicitly, with measures, beats, and notes arranged in chronological order. SheetMusic takes a different approach by decoupling time from the physical layout of the spreadsheet.</p><p>The paper explains: “In SheetMusic, time passes independently of the spreadsheet, communicating its current value to all the formulae in the spreadsheet once per ‘tick’.” This means users can organize their musical elements based on logical relationships rather than temporal sequence.</p><p>This approach contrasts with other grid-based music tools like Manhattan, which “sacrifices much layout flexibility by committing columns to denote tracks which execute in parallel, and rows to represent time slices which execute sequentially.” SheetMusic prioritizes layout flexibility, “freeing the layout of the spreadsheet for use as arbitrary secondary notation.”</p><h2 id="limitations-that-need-to-be-addressed-in-future-versions">Limitations That Need to Be Addressed in Future Versions</h2><p>While the SheetMusic prototype demonstrates interesting possibilities, it remains in the early stages of development with several limitations. The paper acknowledges that “the precise specification of music/sound-generating library is still emergent,” suggesting that the current functionality is limited and experimental.</p><p>The implementation of time as discrete “ticks” may prove inadequate for complex musical compositions requiring precise timing variations. Currently, notes requiring “sub-tick durations” must be expressed through “stretching/squeezing and offset parameters,” which the paper admits is “an inconvenient notation.”</p><p>Additionally, as with any end-user programming tool, there will be a tension between simplicity and expressiveness. While the prototype allows for “arbitrary Javascript code” in each cell, providing tremendous flexibility for advanced users, this might create barriers for novices who lack programming experience.</p><p>The prototype also appears to lack many standard features of music production software, such as mixing capabilities, effects processing, and instrument selection. These would need to be developed for SheetMusic to compete with established music creation tools.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><p>Sarkar, A.
